    <p>
      Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish that can be made in many different
      ways. It typically consists of layers of pasta, sauce, cheese and other
      ingredients which are then baked in an oven until it becomes hot and
      bubbly on the inside while remaining firm on the outside. Lasagna is
      usually served hot but can also be served cold or at room temperature.
      People have been making lasagna since ancient times - as far back as 500
      BCE when it was first recorded in a cookbook called Apicius by Marcus
      Gavius Apicius who was from Italy himself. The earliest known recipe for
      lasagna dates back to 1390 AD when it appeared in a cookbook called Liber
      de Coquina by an Italian chef named Maestro Martino.
