    <h2>Grilled cheese is my favorite dish</h2>
    <p>
      The traditional American grilled cheese sandwich is made with sliced white
      bread and American cheese, although there are many variations on the
      recipe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bread:</strong> a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works
        best
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Butter:</strong> use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice
        of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese:</strong> we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar,
        gouda and Havarti cheese.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make Grilled Cheese Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>How long to cook grilled cheese?</strong> Total cooking time for
      grilled cheese over low to medium/low heat is 6-7 minutes. That is enough
      time for the exterior to crisp and brown and allow the cheese to fully
      melt.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Butter the toast:</strong> spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of
        each slice of bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heat skillet:</strong> place a skillet over low to medium/low
        heat. A griddle should be at 275ËšF. Immediately add 2 slices of bread
        with the butter-side-down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add cheese:</strong> stack cheeses on one of the pieces of
        bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Brown the toast:</strong> Continue sauteeing, flipping once,
        until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to
        serve.
